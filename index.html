                           <p>Computer vision is a field in Artificial intelligence wherein a computer can be trained to scan, identify living or non-living things in its surroundings at a speed and scale not possible by humans and to meaningfully analyse the surroundings to ensure safety and enable a wide array of other applications. </p>
                           <h4>Image Recognition</h4>

                           <p>Image recognition is tasked with detecting and identifying people, items, places, writing or otherwise specific features on an image. Vision data like pictures from different manufacturing steps in a production line, for instance, could be used to make real-time decisions based on real-time detections of any quality or process deviation in real-time.<br> Historical data could also be batch processed to gain insight on the current production procedure to seek continuous improvement. <br> We can provide vision systems that can be leveraged across multiple fields by leveraging different tools: in addition to the classification models described above, we can use Image Segmentation methods that are used to divide (segment) each image in multiple areas so that each pixel belongs to a known label.</p>

                           <h4> Object Detection</h4>

                            <p> Object detection adds localization to the former family of models by providing exact information regarding the position of multiple objects within the images. The application field for these models is extremely varied and includes, for example:</p>

                            <ul>
                              <li>   Detection of production issues or defects in manufacturing</li>
                              <li>   Automation of visual inspections of equipment or buildings </li>
                              <li>   Warehousing automation and inventory assessments </li>
                              <li>   Characterising different production stages in the pharmaceutical industry </li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Optical character recognition models convert images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text and are used for translation services, licence plate recognition and road-side signage information extraction.</p>

                            <p> Our services also include ad-hoc AI systems like Face Recognition models that match known pictures of individuals to new images even when partial occlusion or angle variations are present. Using distinctive facial features like the distance between the eyes or the shape of the cheekbones, the algorithms produce a condensed representation of the detected face for easy comparison against a database. </p>

                            <p>Moving from image to Video Analytics, we can leverage additional information to a series of images (frames in a video) by taking into account the features that are relevant across multiple frames. </p>

                            <p>Video Recognition<br>Video inputs can provide supplementary information in subsequent images such as a new angle/view of an object or the evolution of a person’s motion. We can translate this extra data into a deeper knowledge and insight through video processing algorithms that are at the core of functionalities like:
                            <br>Human Activity Recognition tools can be used to assess what activities a person is carrying out and are used in security systems, sport and health surveillance, medical and disability assistance, gaming and human-computer interaction, retail theft prevention.</p>

                            <ul>

                           <p>Computer vision is a field in Artificial intelligence wherein a computer can be trained to scan, identify living or non-living things in its surroundings at a speed and scale not possible by humans and to meaningfully analyse the surroundings to ensure safety and enable a wide array of other applications. </p>
                           <h4>Image Recognition</h4>

                           <p>Image recognition is tasked with detecting and identifying people, items, places, writing or otherwise specific features on an image. Vision data like pictures from different manufacturing steps in a production line, for instance, could be used to make real-time decisions based on real-time detections of any quality or process deviation in real-time.<br> Historical data could also be batch processed to gain insight on the current production procedure to seek continuous improvement. <br> We can provide vision systems that can be leveraged across multiple fields by leveraging different tools: in addition to the classification models described above, we can use Image Segmentation methods that are used to divide (segment) each image in multiple areas so that each pixel belongs to a known label.</p>

                           <h4> Object Detection</h4>

                            <p> Object detection adds localization to the former family of models by providing exact information regarding the position of multiple objects within the images. The application field for these models is extremely varied and includes, for example:</p>

                            <ul>
                              <li>   Detection of production issues or defects in manufacturing</li>
                              <li>   Automation of visual inspections of equipment or buildings </li>
                              <li>   Warehousing automation and inventory assessments </li>

                            <p> Our services also include ad-hoc AI systems like Face Recognition models that match known pictures of individuals to new images even when partial occlusion or angle variations are present. Using distinctive facial features like the distance between the eyes or the shape of the cheekbones, the algorithms produce a condensed representation of the detected face for easy comparison against a database. </p>

We can translate this extra data into a deeper knowledge and insight through video processing algorithms that are at the core of functionalities like:

                <h4>Fuel Cells</h4>
                <p>Fuel cells are clean energy converters. Chemical energy can be converted to electricity and heat, typically causing no harmful emissions. In the case of a fuel cell, energy is stored outside of the electrochemical cell, making it an open system. To offer power over prolonged periods, larger fuel storage would be needed, whereas the fuel cell unit size remains unchanged.</p>

                <h4>EHPs</h4>
                <p>Electrochemical hydrogen pu­rifiers separate hydrogen from a mixture of industrial gases con­sisting NH₃, N₂, CO₂, CO, CH₄, H₂S among others using only a tiny amount of energy and are similar in construction to fuel cells. Similar techniques can be employed to separate singular gas species from multiple gas streams ejected from steel, chlor-alkali, chemical, oil and gas industries and the like.</p>

                <h4>Batteries</h4>
                <p>Batteries are electrochemical cells wherein energy is stored and converted from special materials and redox reactions. These are closed systems as opposed to fuel cells. Therefore, to offer power over longer pe­riods, additional units are nee­ded. Energy storage and con­version are closely em­bed­ded inside a battery com­part­ment. Efficient material recyc­ling, low carbon foot-print are focal areas.</p>
